            <p>French is one of the world’s major languages. It is a main or official language not just in France, but in parts of Belgium and Switzerland, in Monaco, in parts of Canada – notably but not only in Quebec – as well as being widely spoken in
                north and west Africa, Lebanon, and parts of south-east Asia, particularly in former French colonies. It is an official or a main second language in 55 countries worldwide, and is reputed to be the foreign language which is most widely
                used in international communications, after English. Almost 300 million people speak French as their native language or as a second language. Until the early twentieth century, French was the language of diplomacy, and one of the two main
                languages of international negotiation; today it is one of the six official languages of the United Nations, and one of the two official languages, with English, of the International Postal Union, of the International Olympic Committee,
                the International Red Cross, and other organisations. It is also an official language in the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey. </p>
